## Unreleased

### Fixed

- The Rendered viewport no longer looks washed out until the first F12: the scene is set to the Raw view transform (look None, dithering 0) when the viewport first starts on it, and when a Bryce document is imported. Blender's Color Management panel is now shown with the Stecyk3D engine.
- The Material tab's Texture components panel and the per-channel mix rows no longer stop with an error when a texture or mix comes through a node group.
- Render Animation now draws the sky of each frame: keyframed or driven sky settings (haze, the sky's sun direction, and the rest) used to keep the values of the frame the render started at. Exact png writes one file per frame of an animation instead of overwriting one, and is saved where Blender saves its own output (a relative path on Windows with no drive and no `//` goes on the drive's root, as Blender's `Saved:` line shows; the Render tab now says where).
- Trees grown from Tree Lab settings stand where their objects are; they all stood at the world origin. The renderer now reads an object's place from the fourth column of the matrix a description gives (it read the fourth row, which holds no place), so a tree or shape given only `matrix` moves too.
- A tree whose Tree Lab settings grow a piece of wood with no thickness (a *Thickness* of 0, as a tree fresh from *Add > Bryce shape > Tree* has, or often a *Least* of 0) is refused with a message naming the tree and the setting. It turned the whole picture black.
- Every preset of Bryce 5.0's material and texture libraries now applies. Material presets with a mixed channel (Distant Mountain, Whole Mountain, Riverbed, Wet Rock, Desert I, Walnut and others) and Tutorial Light Gel stopped with "float() argument must be ... not 'NoneType'"; texture presets whose saved result is not a number (most bump textures, such as techno city 2) stopped when added. The Tree Lab's libraries (Leaves, Trunks), which begin with blanks, now open, and the empty User libraries (Materials/User/User.mat, Textures/User/User.brt) open with no presets instead of being called damaged. Ion Damage is still refused (its texture has no component).

### Name

- The project is now called Stecyk3D (add-on "Stecyk3D for Blender", render engine "Stecyk3D", programs `stecyk3d-render`, `stecyk3d-extract`, `stecyk3d-cases`). Files and settings saved under the earlier working name move over by themselves: opening a scene switches it to the Stecyk3D engine, its custom properties are renamed, and the Bryce folders, substrate file and program paths from the old preferences are copied once. The old default substrate file is still found.

### Blender add-on

- *Bryce material from the Blender shader* carries more of the Principled BSDF: Transmission Weight (Transparency, with the base colour as the Transparent colour), IOR (Refraction, for transmitted light), Specular IOR Level above 0.5 (Reflection, full at 1) and Specular Tint (Specular colour), with Diffusion keeping Blender's diffuse share under a glass or mirror. A Principled glass or mirror now converts to one. Inputs left at Blender's defaults give the same material as before; a set Coat, Sheen, Subsurface, Anisotropic, Thin Film or Diffuse Roughness is reported as not carried.
- A terrain whose picture is not 16, 32, ... 1024 points a side (grid Auto) is no longer refused: it is resampled to the next of those sizes up (at most 1024), bilinear over the same area, and the render report says so and from what size.
- Optional 90s finishing of the picture after the render, in a closed **Finishing** subpanel of the Render tab: a glow round the sun, moon and glowing objects, a lens flare when the sun or moon shows in the frame, one JPEG round trip at a chosen quality, and a palette of N colours with ordered dither (the GIF look). Not part of Bryce's renderer; all off by default, which leaves the picture Bryce's byte for byte, and Exact png always keeps the renderer's levels.
- A scripting API (`api` module; [docs/manual/scripting.md](docs/manual/scripting.md)) for scripts that build and render Bryce scenes without reaching into the add-on: presets with fallbacks and channel overrides, materials from a colour, shapes and terrains made without the 3D cursor (a terrain from a height function, with the exact height of the drawn surface under a point), the sky and lights by setting name, renders to absolute paths, several looks rendered in one Blender or in parallel headless ones, and a labelled contact sheet. `examples/lake/` builds a moonlit lake scene with it.
- F12 is faster: the add-on no longer pauses while it reads the renderer's picture, and it hands the picture to Blender much faster (a small scene at 640x480: about 1 s -> 0.1 s; at 1920x1440: about 13 s -> 0.5 s). Pictures are unchanged.
- The Rendered viewport restarts at once when you move the view: the render going on is cancelled, and the new view's first pixels appear in a fraction of a second.
- The Rendered viewport draws every pixel from its own random place from the start (set Random grain to Exact to get the program's own grain there too). F12 is unchanged.
- The Render tab's "Wash grain" setting is now called "Random grain", since it covers soft shadows, radius lights and jittered volumes as well as the wash. Saved files keep their setting.
- Panels now offer the settings of the old Bryce interface: the full Render, World (sky), Object, Material and Texture settings, light key buttons and the Light Lab gradient starter, texture mapping, noise, filter, colours, phase and blend, and Mix Materials limits.
- The World tab says where a cloud layer's texture goes (the Bryce Sky node's stratus or cumulus input, in the Shader Editor set to World), and its red lines wrap instead of being cut off. The manual has step-by-step instructions for changing the sky and giving a cloud layer a texture.
- The World tab has a *Sun and moon* switch grid (Halo rings, Secondary ring, Sun/Moon size, Moon phase, Moon picture, Rainbow): the Discs and Moon numbers act only with these switches, which could not be reached before. Sky settings whose effect surprises have tooltips, and the manual's new *Sun, moon and stars* section explains them, with measurements: custom sky colours are seen at 0.7 to 1.2 of their value by the angle to the sun, Moon glow size is a strength that a bright zenith cancels, Moon disc is a brightness, and stars show only where the sky's brightest channel is below 0.26. The unread *Moon picture* image is no longer offered on the World tab. Pictures are unchanged.

### Renderer

- Scenes with metaballs or trees render on every core (glass-vine F12 35.5 s -> 9.7 s; tree-dense 5.0 s -> 0.63 s), with the same picture as before.
- Scenes whose shading uses random numbers no longer spend their exact-order budget on the quick preview before the frame (wash-vol 122-129 s -> 89 s; a soft-shadow scene 63.5 s -> 36 s), same picture.
- The exact mode is faster on scenes heavy in sine, cosine and arctangent, textures, groups and terrains (on one core: smoker 9.5 s -> 1.8 s, clouds 18.4 s -> 7.7 s; vlx and terrain1 also faster). Pictures are unchanged.
- Renders of 3.0 and 3.1 scenes with stars are faster, and rendering is faster again overall, with the same pictures (the CD's space station on one core 1.65 s -> 1.07 s).

## 0.1.0 - first release (experimental)

- Renderer (Rust, MIT): draws Bryce 3.0, 3.1 and 5.0 scenes (`.br3`, `.br5`) and scenes described by the Blender add-on, bit for bit wherever it draws, and refuses with a named reason where it does not. Uses every core.
- Blender add-on (GPL-3.0-or-later): render engine for F12 and the Rendered viewport; live picture with Rows or Scattered order; the Bryce node set in the Shader Editor (Add > Bryce) with node groups followed; Bryce shapes, terrains and groups in the Add menu; Principled BSDF to Bryce material conversion; presets; import of `.br3` / `.br5` documents; a text report of everything a refused render found.
- The substrate (tables and data files the renderer needs) is made by you from your own Bryce install; the package contains none.
- Documentation: a user manual and a "how it works" explanation in `docs/`. Known differences and limits: `docs/manual/troubleshooting.md`.
